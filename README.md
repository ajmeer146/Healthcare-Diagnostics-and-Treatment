# Healthcare-Diagnostics-and-Treatment
Objective
The objective of this project is to modernize healthcare diagnostics and treatment planning by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and secure data handling. The goal is to deliver fast, accurate, and personalized health assessments and treatment suggestions using real-time patient data.

Features
AI-Powered Diagnosis: Automated health condition prediction based on symptoms and real-time vitals.

Personalized Treatment Suggestions: Custom treatment plans tailored to individual patient data.

IoT Integration: Real-time health monitoring using devices tracking vitals like temperature, heart rate, and oxygen levels.

Secure Data Handling: Encrypted storage and access control for patient records.

Performance Monitoring: Tracks accuracy, latency, and system load to ensure optimal performance.

Technology Used
Languages: Python, JavaScript

Tools & Frameworks: Flask/Django (backend), React/HTML (frontend), MQTT for IoT data transfer

Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for ML models), Pandas, NumPy

IoT Components: Sensors for temperature, heart rate, SpO₂

Database: MongoDB / MySQL

Version Control: Git & GitHub
GitHub Repository: Healthcare Diagnostics and Treatment

How It Works
Data Input: Patient enters symptoms; IoT sensors stream real-time vitals.

Data Processing: AI engine processes inputs and matches with trained diagnostic models.

Diagnosis: Condition likelihoods are calculated and returned.

Treatment Plan: Based on diagnosis and patient profile, a treatment suggestion is displayed.

Feedback & Logging: Users and clinicians can provide feedback; system logs for evaluation.

Data Collection
Sources: Public healthcare datasets and simulated IoT health data.

Collection Method: Combined clinical datasets for training the model, and sensor data for live testing.

Controls
User Role: Patients can enter symptoms and view diagnoses.

Doctor/Admin Role: Access detailed reports and manage system functions.

IoT Devices: Automatically collect and transmit patient vitals.

ML Techniques Used
Classification Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees for diagnosis.

Predictive Analytics: Time-series analysis for trends in vitals.

Feature Engineering: Selected key health parameters for improved accuracy.

Model Training
Dataset: Cleaned and labeled medical records with symptoms and diagnoses.

Training Pipeline: Preprocessing → Model training → Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

Validation: Tested on unseen data and optimized for clinical-grade reliability.

Output Explanation
Diagnosis Output: Probabilities of potential conditions.

Treatment Output: Suggested therapies, medications, or referrals.

IoT Metrics Display: Real-time dashboard with vitals and diagnostic results.
