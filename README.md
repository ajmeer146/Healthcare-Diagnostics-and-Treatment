# Healthcare-Diagnostics-and-Treatment
## Objective
The objective of this project is to modernize healthcare diagnostics and treatment planning by leveraging Artificial 	Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and secure data handling. The goal is to deliver fast, accurate, and personalized health assessments and treatment suggestions using real-time patient data.
## Features
AI-Powered Diagnosis: Automated health condition prediction based on symptoms and real-time vitals.
Personalized Treatment Suggestions: Custom treatment plans tailored to individual patient data
IoT Integration: Real-time health monitoring using devices tracking vitals like temperature, heart rate, and oxygen levels.
Secure Data Handling: Encrypted storage and access control for patient records.
Performance Monitoring: Tracks accuracy, latency, and system load to ensure optimal performance.

## Technology Used
Languages: Python, JavaScript
Tools & Frameworks: Flask/Django (backend), React/HTML (frontend), MQTT for IoT data transfer
Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for ML models), Pandas, NumPy
IoT Components: Sensors for temperature, heart rate, SpOâ‚‚
Database: MongoDB / MySQL
Version Control: Git & GitHub
GitHub Repository: Healthcare Diagnostics and Treatment

## How It Works
Data Input: Patient enters symptoms; IoT sensors stream real-time vitals.
Data Processing: AI engine processes inputs and matches with trained diagnostic models.
Diagnosis: Condition likelihoods are calculated and returned.
Treatment Plan: Based on diagnosis and patient profile, a treatment suggestion is displayed.
Feedback & Logging: Users and clinicians can provide feedback; system logs for evaluation.
